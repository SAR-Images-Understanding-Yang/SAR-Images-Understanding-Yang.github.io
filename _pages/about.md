I'm a second year doctoral student from [School of Automation](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes SAR target detection and regnition, segmentation, and transfer learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lianmeng Jiao](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/jiaolianmeng.html) of PRIDE Lab from [School of Automation](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/).
